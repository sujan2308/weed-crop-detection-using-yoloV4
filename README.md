# weed-crop-detection-using-yoloV4
This project implements an object detection system based on the YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once) algorithm for the detection and classification of weeds and crops in agricultural fields. The aim is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for farmers to identify and manage weed populations, enabling targeted and optimized use of herbicides.
